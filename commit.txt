Fix second pass feedback

- actionRatio to slow down while correcting
- switchValue may be -bitValue
- input updated after each switch activation
- third and subsequent passes allow multiple-pass changes
- key goes green when it is time to confirm it
- you can hold the switch down for several consecutive bits
